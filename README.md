If you want fast work on LOCAL MACHINE, DO NOT download this release, because i use new library that dont have multi-threading.
This release is made for hosting, and if you want it, you would:

1. Download library from pip: 
    `pip install weather-ch`
2. Singup on [https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx](url) and get an api key
3. Insert in in `weatherAPI` variable (main.py)
4. If you already has Telegram bot api, insert it in `bot`  variable (main.py), otherwise, see `main` branch README.md
5. Run main.py
